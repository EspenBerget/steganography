# Steganography in Golang

## What? 
Steganography is the practice of concealing a information within other information.
Using this concept you can send information without anyone even knowing that information was sent.
This differ from standard encryption where third parties usually are aware that information was sent.

## Why?
To have a toy project where I can learn the image library of Golang.

## Conclusion
Go's image library seems flexible, and there might be better ways of doing this, that I did not explore.
I might look at them if I revisits this project, maybe try a better steganography technique.

#### Notes
* Only works with gray images for now, but has a gray command that takes an JPEG or PNG image
and makes it a gray PNG image.
